# CyherGraphExporter Example

This example builds the custom OpenTelemetry collector and creates a tracing pipeline that listens to OTLP on localhost:4317 and that send the traces to two Cyphers exporters, one connecting to a Neo4j instance and the other one to a Memgraph instance:

- The Neo4j instance listens the bolt protocol on the port 7687 and the Neo4j Web UI on the port 7444.
- The Memgraph instance listens the bolt protocol on the port 7688. An instance of Memgraph-Labs runs in another container listening HTTP requests on the port 3000.

Traces are generated by the `telemetrygen` [[1]] container that emit some traces to the collector and exits.

```
docker compose up
```
